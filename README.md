A game celebrating the famous "playing chess with a pigeon" quote that recently turned 20 :

This is a project I wanted to make for fun and for the challenge, to hone my dev skills a lil bit.

In a nutshell : Pigeon Chess is a chess/debate game where the opponent is a pigeon. You choose the topic and the opponent, from a selection of popular irrational theories.
You also indicate your level of expertise. You start the game by choosing from the first 20 possible moves, each move corresponding to an argument (displayed in a dialogue bubble).
After the first move, the pigeon knocks the pieces, craps on the board, struts around like it won, and flies back to his flock to announce its victory (as in the quote).

My intent isn't to mock the people who believe in theories going against science. I believe debating them, and belittling them to make them admit they are wrong, is not the right human approach.
I'll let Peter McIndoe, founder of the Birds Aren't Real movement, convince you of that : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VEkzweBJPM
Another quote to conclude : "Arguing with a fool proves there are two."
